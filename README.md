# Tauri Webapp Creator

This is a simple python script that similarly to Nativefier creates a webapp given a url.
But instead of using Electron and therefore a resource hungry fully blown Chromium-instance it uses Tauri for a lightweight executable.

## Usage
Go into the python file and adapt the `target` and `app_name` variables

## TODOs
 - [ ] Add support for some common arguments
 - [ ] Figure out why the AppImages don't work certain tasks, e.g. YoutubeMusic (i.e. figure out how to add the missing gstreamer dependencies)
